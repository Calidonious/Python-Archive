Hello There!

This is my python archive

it has all the python scripts ive writen so far while learning python.
all the scripts can be run individually but they are supposed to be run by the main file which is calidonious python archive.py
as it is like the main menu of the program, containing account functionality and custom color themes and you can set the appearance mode from light to dark or system
when you set the appearance mode it will happen instantly but if you dont hit the save button it will change back to the last saved when the program restarts

i have made a few custom json files for custom color themes for my program unlike the appearance mode customTkinter needs the program to restart in order to set the color theme
you just select the color you want and hit the save theme button and the program will warn you its going to auto restart and it will reopen with your selected color theme

required modules to compile the project from source:
tkinter, 
Customtkinkter, 
pillow, 
hashlib, 
forex for python (for the currency converter script)


in the releases i will release a installer.exe for this that will allow you to install the program to any location and place a shortcut on the desktop for you
the installer has a uninstaller that is in your chosen install dir

i compiled the installer using nsis and when i download it from github it tells me it might be malicious i dont know why this is as i dont know much about nsis
but i think its because of that eather way the program is safe even though i wrote it ive also tested it to be sure

i will also release a precomepiled compressed folder if you just want to uncompress and run the calidonious python archive.exe without installing it

when you first start the program you will be in the login menu just create and account and login and your good to go you can delete your account in the main menu
when you login the time you login is saved and it will log you out if more then 30 mins has passed it will not boot you out though it waits tell you close the program
and the next time you open the program you will need to login again so as long as you keep the program open you can stay logged in
